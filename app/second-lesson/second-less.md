  - Enumerating properties with (for...in | Object.keys(myObj) | Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObj))
  - Accessing properties with (Dot notation | Bracket notation)
  - Deleting properties with "delete" operator
  - Defining methods
  - Comparing objects
  - Mutability and Immutability

- Classes (ES6)

  - Classes - syntactic sugar for prototypes
  - Instances of class
  - new & this keywords
  - Inheritance
  - Override methods of parent class
  - _proto_ object

- Prototype model (Before ES6)

  - Constructor function
  - Defining methods
  - Inheritance with apply()

- 4 main principles in OOP

  - Abstraction

- What exactly the "new" keyword does:

- Create a prototype or new empty object {}
- sets the value of this to be the new empty object
- calls the constructor method
