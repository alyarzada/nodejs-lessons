        // - Task 2: Composition and Aggregation.
        //   You are developing a music player application. Create a prototype named Song with properties title, artist, and duration. Implement a method play() that displays a message indicating the song is playing. Then, create a prototype named Playlist that can hold an array of Song objects. Implement methods for adding and removing songs from the playlist, as well as a playAll() method that plays each song in the playlist in sequence. -->
